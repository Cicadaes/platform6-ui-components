Some interfaces are not explained in this documentation because they are part of <span className='quote'>redux-form</span> such as [Normalize](https://redux-form.com/6.6.2/examples/normalizing/) or [Validate](https://redux-form.com/6.6.2/examples/fieldlevelvalidation/).

You don't need to install <span className='quote'>redux-form</span> on your service as it is already provided by the [platform6-ui](#platform-6-ui) project.

You can visit their website for more [details](https://redux-form.com/).

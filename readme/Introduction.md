This documentation regroups all the components available for you to develop your own service on <blockquote>Platform 6</blockquote>.

Some components will require properties from the service root component, it will be precised in the property description column.

The icons we are using are [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free) classes. Each time you see a property <blockquote>iconName</blockquote> remember to use them.

We provide few classes like <blockquote>background color</blockquote>, <blockquote>text color</blockquote>, <blockquote>text size</blockquote> and more. You should take a look [here](#commons-classes) before using the components.

Edit the code and see the example being edited for each component.

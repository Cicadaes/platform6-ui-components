This documentation regroups all the components available for you to develop your own service on <span className='quote'>Platform 6</span>.

Some components will require properties from the service root component, it will be precised in the property description column.

The icons we are using are [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free) classes. Each time you see a property <span className='quote'>iconName</span> remember to use them.

We provide few classes like <span className='quote'>background color</span>, <span className='quote'>text color</span>, <span className='quote'>text size</span> and more. You should take a look [here](#commons-classes) before using the components.

Edit the code and see the example being edited for each component.
